            <strong>THESE TERMS OF SERVICE (“TERMS”) GOVERN YOUR USE OF OUR SERVICE. IF YOU REGISTER FOR A FREE TRIAL OR BETA OF OUR SERVICE, THESE TERMS WILL ALSO GOVERN THAT FREE TRIAL OR BETA.</strong>
        </p>
        <h4>1. ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS</h4>
        <p>
            <strong>1.1</strong> Zentralized Ltd. (&#8220;Zentralized,&#8221; “We” or ”Our”) provides its Service (as defined below) to You through its web site located at vizzop.com (the “Site”), subject to these Terms.

If You are entering into these Terms on behalf of a company or another legal entity, You represent that You have the authority to bind such entity and its affiliates to these Terms, in which case the terms “You,” “Your” or related capitalized terms herein shall refer to such entity and its affiliates.

        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>1.3</strong> You acknowledge that these Terms constitute a contract between You and Zentralized, even though it is electronic and is not physically signed by You and Zentralized, and that these Terms govern Your use of the Service and supersede any other agreements between You and Zentralized.
        </p>
        <h4>2. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE</h4>
        <p>
            The “Service” includes (a) the Site, (b) the on-demand Zentralized® system, tools and Zentralized API, and (c) the other services provided to You through the Site based on the plan purchased, including all software, data, text, images, sounds, videos, and other content made available through the Site, or developed via the Zentralized API (collectively, “Content”). Any new features added to or augmenting the Service are also subject to these Terms.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Service may also include basic or expanded support based on the Service plan purchased. Zentralized does its very best to make the Service available as detailed in the applicable Service plan, except for: (a) planned downtime (of which You will be notified in advance), or (b) any unavailability caused by circumstances beyond Our reasonable control, such as, but not limited to, acts of God, acts of government, acts of terror or civil unrest, or technical failures beyond Our control.
        </p>
        <h4>3. GENERAL CONDITIONS/ACCESS AND USE OF THE SERVICE</h4>
        <p>
            <strong>3.1</strong> Subject to the terms and conditions of these Terms, You agree to access and use the Service only for Your business purposes as contemplated by these Terms.
        </p>
        <p>
            Subject only to Your limited right to access and use the Service as expressly granted to You here, all rights, title and interest in and to the Service and its components, including all related intellectual property rights, will remain with and belong exclusively to Zentralized and its third-party vendors.

        <p>
            <strong>3.2</strong> You agree not to (a) license, sublicense, sell, resell, rent, lease, transfer, assign, distribute, time share or otherwise commercially exploit or make the Service available to any third party, other than as expressly permitted by these Terms; (b) use the Service to process data on behalf of any third party, (c) modify, adapt or hack the Service to falsely imply any sponsorship or association with Zentralized, or otherwise attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Service or its related systems or networks; (d) use the Service in any unlawful manner, including but not limited to violation of any persons privacy rights, infringing any person’s intellectual property rights, or sending spam or otherwise duplicative or unsolicited messages in violation of applicable law, (e) use the Service in any manner that interferes with or disrupts the integrity or performance of the Service and its components; (f) attempt to decipher, decompile, reverse engineer or otherwise discover the source code of any software making up the Service; (g) use the Service to knowingly post, upload, link to, send or store any content that is unlawful, racist, hateful, obscene, discriminatory, or contains any viruses, malware, Trojan horses, time bombs, or any other similar harmful software; or (h) try to use, or use the Service in violation of these Terms.

You may create separate logins for as many people as Your plan allows, and otherwise utilize Our unique Multi-Branding and Light Agent features if your plan includes these features.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>3.4</strong> Zentralized’s failure to enforce at any time any provision of these Terms does not constitute a waiver of that provision or of any other provision of these Terms.
        </p>
        <h4>4. DATA PRIVACY AND SECURITY</h4>
        <p>
            <strong>4.1</strong> In providing You the Service We shall maintain appropriate administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the security, confidentiality and integrity of Your data and the personal data of Your end-users. These safeguards include encryption of Your data in transmission (using SSL or similar technologies), except for certain external third party integrations that do not support encryption, which You may link to the Service at Your choice.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>4.2</strong> You agree that Zentralized can access Your accounts information in order to respond to Your service requests. We will not disclose such data except if compelled by law, permitted by You, or pursuant to the terms of the Zentralized Privacy Policy, which is incorporated into these Terms.
        </p>
        <h4>5. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS</h4>
        <p>
            Each of us shall maintain all rights, title and interest in and to all our respective patents, inventions, copyrights, trademarks, domain names, trade secrets, know-how and any other intellectual property and/or proprietary rights (collectively, “Intellectual Property Rights”). The rights granted to You to use the Service under these Terms do not convey any additional rights in the Service, or in any Intellectual Property Rights associated therewith. Zentralized shall have a royalty-free, worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, irrevocable and perpetual license to incorporate into the Service or otherwise use any suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or other feedback We receive from You. Zentralized®, and Zentralized’s other product and service names, and logos used or displayed on the Service are registered or unregistered trademarks of Zentralized (collectively, “Marks”), and You may only use such Marks to identify yourself as a customer and user of the Service; provided You do not attempt, now or in the future, to claim any rights in the Marks, degrade the distinctiveness of the Marks, or use the Marks to disparage or misrepresent Zentralized, its services or products.
        </p>
        <h4>6. THIRD PARTY SERVICES</h4>
        <p>
            <strong>6.1 External Sites.</strong> The Service may contain links to, or otherwise may allow You to connect to and use certain third party products, services or software under separate terms and conditions (collectively, “Other Services”) in conjunction with Our Service. If You decide to access and use such Other Services, be advised that Your use is governed solely by the terms and conditions of such Other Services, and We do not endorse, are not responsible for, and make no representations as to such Other Services, their content or the manner in which they handle Your data. Zentralized is not liable for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with Your access or use of any such Other Services, or Your reliance on the privacy practices or other policies of such Other Services.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>6.2 Integration.</strong> The Service may contain features that enable various Other Services (such as social media services like Facebook and Twitter) to be directly integrated into your Zentralized experience. To take advantage of these features, You will be required to register for or log into such Other Services on their respective websites. By enabling third party services within the Service, You are allowing Zentralized to pass Your log-in information to these Other Services for this purpose.
        </p>
        <h4>7. BILLING, PLAN MODIFICATIONS AND PAYMENTS</h4>
        <p>
            <strong>7.1 Billing and Payments.</strong> The Service is made available on a pay-as-you-go basis and is charged at the start of Your elected subscription term (generally monthly or annually). If You do not provide Your credit card or other payment information to Zentralized before the expiration of any free trial period, Your account will be suspended until payment information and charge authorization are provided. You will be promptly billed and, if applicable, any trial period will terminate. Thereafter, Your subscription will renew automatically based on Your plan’s renewal cycle. The Service provides an interface for the account owner to change credit card information (e.g., upon card renewal). The account owner will receive a receipt upon each payment received, or they may obtain a receipt from within the application to be able to track the status of Your subscription.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>7.2 Modifying Your Subscription.</strong> If You choose to upgrade Your plan or number of agents during Your elected subscription period, any incremental cost will be prorated over the remaining term of the subscription period and charged to Your account. Subsequently, You will be charged the adjusted rate on Your next billing cycle. If You are on a monthly billing cycle, You will not see a prorated charge or credit in the current month, but Your new billing rate will be reflected on Your next monthly bill. Regardless of Your billing cycle, there are no refunds or credits for partial months of Service, plan downgrades, or refunds for unused time if You close Your account before the end of Your subscription period. No exceptions will be made in order to treat everyone equally and keep Our administrative costs low for the ultimate benefit of Our customer base. Downgrading Your plan level may cause the loss of content, features, or capacity of Your account and Zentralized does not accept any liability for such loss. Zentralized reserves the right to contact You about special pricing if You maintain an exceptionally high number of end-users, an unusually high monthly ticket ratio per agent, an unusually high level of open tickets or other excessive stress on the Service.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>7.3 Overdue charges.</strong> If You fail to pay your subscription fee on time, or if Your credit card payment information is entered in error or does not go through for processing and You do not update payment information upon Our request, your entire subscription may be suspended or cancelled.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>7.4 Billing Privacy.</strong> Zentralized uses a third-party intermediary to manage credit card processing and this intermediary is not permitted to store, retain, or use Your billing information except to process Your credit card information for Zentralized. For more information about Our billing practices and Your personal information please visit Our Privacy Policy.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>7.5 Taxes.</strong> Unless otherwise stated, Our charges do not include any taxes, levies, duties or similar governmental assessments, including value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes assessable by any local, state, provincial or foreign jurisdiction (collectively “Taxes”). You are responsible for paying Taxes except those assessable against Zentralized based on its income. We will invoice You for such Taxes if we believe we have a legal obligation to do so.
        </p>
        <h4>9 CANCELLATION AND TERMINATION</h4>
        <p>
            <strong>9.1</strong> The account owner (as defined in the sign-up procedure) is responsible for canceling Your account, and can cancel the account by either clicking on the account link in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen (for immediate cancellation if You paid by credit card) or by contacting Zentralized at customer.service@vizzop.com. There are no other means of canceling Your account. Once You cancel Your account You will lose access to all of Your content, and We preserve the right to delete all such content in the normal course of operation. This content cannot be recovered once Your account is cancelled. If You cancel the Service before the end of Your current paid-up subscription period, Your cancellation will take effect immediately and You will not be charged again.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>9.2</strong> Zentralized reserves the right to (i) modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Service (or any part thereof) and (ii) refuse any/all current and future use of the Service, suspend or terminate your account or any part thereof (or Your use of the Service), and remove and discard any of Your content within the Service if We believe that You have violated these Terms. Zentralized will use all reasonable efforts to contact You directly via email to warn You prior to suspension or termination of Your account. Any suspected fraudulent, abusive, or illegal activity may be grounds for immediate termination of Your use of Service, and may be referred to law enforcement authorities. Zentralized shall not be liable to You or any third party for any modification, suspension or discontinuation of the Service.
        </p>
        <h4>10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</h4>
        <p>
            THE SERVICE, INCLUDING THE SITE AND CONTENT, AND ALL SERVER AND NETWORK COMPONENTS ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS, WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, AND Zentralized EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT Zentralized DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE, ERROR-FREE OR VIRUS-FREE, AND NO INFORMATION OR ADVICE OBTAINED BY YOU FROM Zentralized OR THROUGH THE SERVICE SHALL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE TERMS.
        </p>
        <h4>11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h4>
        <p>
            <strong>11.1 NO CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES.</strong> UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) WILL EITHER PARTY TO THESE TERMS, OR SUCH PARTY’S AFFILIATES OR THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, SUPPLIERS OR LICENSORS BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR OTHER SIMILAR DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS, LOST SALES OR BUSINESS, LOST DATA, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION OR ANY OTHER LOSS INCURRED BY SUCH PARTY IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR THE SERVICE, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF OR COULD HAVE FORESEEN SUCH DAMAGES.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>11.2 LIMITS ON MONETARY DAMAGES.</strong> NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THESE TERMS, Zentralized’S (INCLUDING ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES) AGGREGATE LIABILITY, FOR DAMAGES (MONETARY OR OTHERWISE) UNDER THESE TERMS CLAIMED BY YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY ARISING FROM OUR SERVICE, SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE LESSER OF (I) ACTUAL DAMAGES INCURRED, OR (II) PAYMENTS MADE BY YOU FOR THE SERVICE DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM. THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF THIS SECTION 11.2 IS TO ALLOCATE THE RISKS UNDER THESE TERMS BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND LIMIT THEIR POTENTIAL LIABILITY GIVEN THE FEES CHARGED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER IF Zentralized WERE TO ASSUME ANY FURTHER LIABILITY OTHER THAN AS SET FORTH HEREIN. THE PARTIES HAVE RELIED ON THESE LIMITATIONS IN DETERMINING WHETHER TO ENTER INTO THESE TERMS.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>11.3</strong> Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages, which means that some of the above limitations may not apply to You. IN THESE STATES, Zentralized’S LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.
        </p>
        <h4>12. INDEMNIFICATION</h4>
        <p>
            <strong>12.1 Indemnification by Zentralized.</strong> Zentralized will indemnify and hold You harmless, from and against any claim against You by reason of Your use of the Service as permitted hereunder, brought by a third party alleging that the Service infringes a valid patent or copyright, or misappropriates a third party’s trade secret (such claims, collectively, “Claim”). Zentralized shall, at its expense, defend such Claim and pay damages finally awarded against You in connection therewith, including the reasonable fees and expenses of the attorneys engaged by Zentralized for such defense, provided that (i) You promptly notify Zentralized of the threat or notice of such Claim, (ii) Zentralized will have the sole and exclusive control and authority to select defense attorneys, defend and/or settle any such Claim, and (iii) You fully cooperate with Zentralized in connection therewith. If Your use of the Service has become, or in Zentralized’s opinion is likely to become, the subject of any such Claim, Zentralized may at its option and expense (a) procure for You the right to continue using the Service as set forth hereunder; (b) replace or modify the Service to make it non-infringing; or (c) if options (a) or (b) are not reasonably practicable, terminate these Terms and repay You any unused Service fees. Zentralized will have no liability or obligation under this Section 12.1 with respect to any Claim if such claim is caused in whole or in part by (i) compliance with designs, data, instructions or specifications provided by You; (ii) modification of the Service by anyone other than Zentralized; or (iii) the combination, operation or use of the Service with other hardware or software where the Service would not by itself be infringing.
        </p>
        <p>
            The provisions of this Section 12.1 state the sole, exclusive and entire liability of Zentralized to You and constitute Your sole remedy with respect to a Claim brought by reason of Your permitted use of the Service.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>12.2 Indemnification by You.</strong> You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Zentralized from and against any claims, actions or demands, including, without limitation, reasonable legal and professional services fees, arising or resulting from Your breach of these Terms, or Your and Your end users’ access to, use, misuse or illegal use of the Service. Zentralized will provide You notice of any such claim, suit, or proceeding. Zentralized reserves the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter which is subject to indemnification under this section, in which case You agree to cooperate with any reasonable requests to assist Zentralized’s defense of such matter.
        </p>
        <h4>13. ASSIGNMENT; ENTIRE AGREEMENT; REVISIONS</h4>
        <p>
            Either party may assign or transfer these Terms, in whole or in part, without restriction, provided the assignee agree to be fully bound by these Terms. These Terms supersede prior versions of these Terms, or any other discussions, agreements or understandings by or among the parties (other than written agreements expressly accepted and executed by both parties). We may amend these Terms from time to time, in which case the new Terms will supersede prior versions. We will notify You of such changes and direct You to the latest version.
        </p>
        <h4>14. SEVERABILITY</h4>
        <p>
            If any provision in these Terms is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, such provision shall be modified by the court and interpreted so as to best accomplish the original provision to the fullest extent permitted by law, and the remaining provisions of these Terms shall remain in effect.
        </p>
        <h4>15. RELATIONSHIP OF THE PARTIES</h4>
        <p>
            The parties are independent contractors. These Terms do not create a partnership, franchise, joint venture, agency, fiduciary or employment relationship among the parties.
        </p>
        <h4>16. SURVIVAL</h4>
        <p>
            Sections 3 (General Conditions/Access and Use of the Service), 5 (Intellectual Property Rights), 7 (Billing, Plan Modifications and Payments), 8 (Voice Functionality), 9, (Cancellation and Termination), 10 (Disclaimer of Warranties), 11 (Limitation of Liability), 12 (Indemnification), 13 (Assignment; Entire Agreement; Revisions), 14 (Severability), 15 (Relationship of the Parties) and 17 (Governing Law) will survive any termination of these Terms.
        </p>
        <p>
            ----------------
        </p>
        <h4>Information You Provide</h4>
        <p>
            In this Policy, “personal information” means information or an information set that identifies or could be used by or on behalf of Zentralized to identify an individual, but not including encoded, anonymized, or publically-available data that has not been combined with non-public personal information.
        </p>
        <p>
            The information Zentralized collects and uses is limited to the purpose for which customers engage Zentralized. When You register for the Service, We ask for information such as your name, company name and address, site name, phone number, e-mail address and credit card information. Zentralized uses a third-party intermediary to manage credit card processing. This intermediary is not permitted to store, retain, or use your billing information, except for the sole purpose of credit card processing on Zentralized’s behalf.
        </p>
        <p>
            Zentralized may use the personal information and other information We collect about your use of the Service to operate the Service and tailor it to your needs, for billing, identification and authentication, to contact You about your use of the Service, send you marketing materials (subject to your opt-out option), for research purposes, and to generally improve the content and functionality of the Service and the Site.
        </p>
        <p>
            Zentralized may also share your personal information with its third-party vendors (such as its credit card processor) and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and other services We use to operate the Service and maintain quality user experience. Although Zentralized owns all rights to the software, code, databases, and other Service applications, You retain all rights to your data. Our service providers may not use your personal information for marketing purposes.
        </p>
        <h4>Cookies</h4>
        <p>
            A “cookie” is a piece of information either stored temporarily (session cookie) or placed on your computer&#8217;s hard drive (persistent cookie). The main purpose of a cookie is to allow a web server to identify a user, and serve up customized web pages and/or login information to the user&#8217;s web browser when revisiting a web page. Cookies help us promptly display the information You need and other information which We consider to be of interest to You. By gathering and remembering information about your website preferences through cookies We can provide a better web and marketing experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            When You visit the Site or use the Service, We use “session cookies” to allow the Site or Service to uniquely identify your browser while You are logged in and to enable Zentralized to process your online transactions. Session cookies also help us confirm your identity and are required in order to use the Service. We also use “persistent cookies” that only We can read and use, to identify You as a Zentralized customer and make it easier for You to log into the Service.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a user You can accept or decline the use of cookies through a functionality built into most web browsers. Users who disable their web browsers’ ability to accept cookies will be able to browse our Site, but will not be able to access or take advantage of the Service.
        </p>
        <h4>Clear Gifs (a.k.a Web Beacons)</h4>
        <p>
            Our third-party tracking utility company employs a software technology called clear gifs that helps us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. Unlike cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages.
        </p>
        <p>
            We tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personal information, and use them in our HTML-based emails to learn which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and our marketing campaigns. If You would like to opt-out of these emails, please follow the unsubscribe instructions within our marketing emails.
        </p>
        <h4>Log Files</h4>
        <p>
            As is true with most web sites, Zentralized gathers certain information automatically and stores it in log files. This information includes internet protocol addresses as well as browser, internet service provider, referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and click stream data. Occasionally We may connect personal information to data gathered in our log files, as necessary to improve the Service to individual customers. Otherwise We mostly use this information with no connection to individual users, to analyze trends, administer the Site, or track usage of various features within the Site.
        </p>
        <h4>Links to Other Sites</h4>
        <p>
            Our Site contains links to other websites that are not owned or controlled by Zentralized. Please be aware that We do not determine and We are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of such other sites. We encourage You to be aware when you leave our Site, and read the privacy statements of other websites linked to our Site. This Policy applies only to information collected by this Site.
        </p>
        <h4>Public Forums</h4>
        <p>
            Our Site offers publicly-accessible blogs or community forums. You should be aware that any information You provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us at customer.service@vizzop.com. In some cases, We may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case We will let You know if We are unable to do so and why.
        </p>
        <h4>Customer Testimonials/Comments/Reviews</h4>
        <p>
            From time to time, We post customer testimonials on the Site which may contain personal information. We do obtain the customers’ consent to post their names along with their testimonials.
        </p>
        <h4>Information Sharing</h4>
        <p>
            Except as described in this Policy, Zentralized will not give, sell, rent or loan any personal information to any third party. We may disclose such information to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. We may also share such information if we believe it is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Service, or as otherwise required by law. Zentralized may also provide non-personal, summary or group statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related Site information to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will include no personal information.
        </p>
        <h4>Protection of Information</h4>
        <p>
            Zentralized is committed to ensuring the security of your personal information. We take every precaution to protect the confidentiality and security of the personal information placed on the Site or used within the Service, by employing technological, physical and administrative security safeguards, such as firewalls and carefully-developed security procedures. For example, when You enter sensitive information (such as login credentials and all your activity on our Service platform) We encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). These technologies, procedures and other measures help ensure that your data is safe, secure, and only available to You and to those You authorized access.

        <h4>Notice</h4>
        <p>
            Where Zentralized collects personal information directly from its EU customers, it informs them about the purpose for which it collects and uses their personal information, the choices they have to limit the use of personal information about them, and how to contact Zentralized. Beyond that, We have no direct relationship with our customers’ customers whose personal data We processes. Zentralized’s customers are responsible for complying with the Directive and relevant data protection legislation in the relevant EU member state before sending personal data to Zentralized for processing. We work with our customers to help them provide notice to their customers concerning the purpose for which personal information is collected.
        </p>
        <h4>Choice</h4>
        <p>
            We process and store information on behalf of our customers. If You are a customer of one of our customers and would no longer like to be contacted by one of our customers that uses our Service, please contact that customer directly. If You are our customer and would like to opt-out of getting communications from Zentralized please contact us at customer.service@vizzop.com or follow the unsubscribe instructions included in each marketing email. Requests to opt-out of transfers to our third-party vendors will also be considered, but limitations on data sharing may make it difficult or impossible to provide the Service.

        <h4>Onwards Transfer</h4>
        <p>
            We may transfer personal information to our third-party vendors that help us provide the Service, subject to appropriate confidentiality restrictions. Such transfers are limited to the purposes for which personal data has been transferred to us from our customers. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the provisions in this Policy regarding notice and choice, and the service agreements with our customers. Otherwise We may also share personal information as is required or permitted by law.
